This sketch is built for only ATmega328p based Arduino boards. Compatibility with any other microcontrollers is coincidental and may not be maintained in the future.

Recommended circuit (tested on an Arduino UNO R3):

	GND, R1, C1, Oscilloscope Ground/0Vref
	R1, R2, C1, Oscilloscope CH1
	R2, Digital Pin 9/PB1
	Digital Pin 8, Oscilloscope CH2

	R1,R2	330 ohms
	C1		7 micro F

CH2 of the scope can be used as a trigger for the beginning of the image. The trigger threshold should be around 3V
